# 比特币2100万是怎么来的？

&ensp;比特币最小单位Satoshi 聪，1聪=0.00000001比特币，1Satoshi = 0.00000001 BTC。比特币约定大约10分钟出一个区块（Block），刚开始出块奖励50个比特币，每出210000个区块后奖励减半，所以，大约在2140年出块2100万个比特币后，挖矿的奖励基本为零了，到最后总共能挖出来2100万个比特币。具体Python代码如下：

```python
# Original block reward for miners was 50 BTC = 50 0000 0000 Satoshis
start_block_reward = 50 * 10**8
# 210000 is around every 4 years with a 10 minute block interval
reward_interval = 210000


def max_money():
    current_reward = start_block_reward
    total = 0
    while current_reward > 0:
        total += reward_interval * current_reward
        current_reward /= 2
    return total


print("Total BTC to ever be created:", max_money(), "Satoshis")
```

在shell 终端执行：

 ```shell
$ python max_money.py
('Total BTC to ever be created:', 2099999997690000, 'Satoshis')
 ```

2099 9999 97690000 聪大约等于2100万个比特币。
